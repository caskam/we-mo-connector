# Smart Device

The Wi-Fi enabled [Belkin WeMo Insight Switch] connects appliances and electronic devices to your Wi-Fi network, allowing you to turn devices on or off, program customized notifications and change device status - from anywhere. WeMo Insight Switch can monitor your electronics and will send information about the deviceâ€™s energy usage directly to your smartphone or tablet. Perfect to pair with space heaters, wall A/C units, TVs, washers, dryers, fans, lights and more. 

# UPnP Protocol

The WeMo Insight Switch uses [Universal Plug And Play (UPnP)] as the underlying discovery and control mechanism. This API allows you to make RESTful calls to the device, which then converts it to UPnP in the API implementation.

**PS: This API works with the version of WeMo Insight as of Feb 2015. There is no guarantee that future versions of Belkin's switches will support the same underlying protocol or operations**
